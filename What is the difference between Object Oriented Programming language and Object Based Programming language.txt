Object Oriented Programming languages like Java and C++ follow
concepts of OOPS like- Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism
and Inheritance etc.
Object Based Programming languages follow some features of
OOPS but they do not provide support for Polymorphism and
Inheritance. Egg. JavaScript, VBScript etc.
Object Based Programming languages provide support for Objects
and you can build objects from constructor. They languages also
support Encapsulation. These are also known as Prototype-oriented
languages.
