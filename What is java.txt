Java is a programming language that produces software for multiple platforms. 
When a programmer writes a Java application, the compiled code (known as bytecode) 
runs on most operating systems (OS), including Windows, Linux and Mac OS. 
Java derives much of its syntax from the C and C++ programming languages.

Java was developed in the mid-1990s by James A. Gosling, a former computer scientist 
with Sun Microsystems.

It is a widely used programming language expressly designed for use in the distributed 
environment of the internet.
Java can be used to create complete applications that may run on a single computer or be 
distributed among servers and clients in a network.

There are many places where Java is used in real world, starting from commercial 
e-commerce website to android apps, from scientific application to financial applications 
like electronic trading systems, from games like Minecraft to desktop applications like Eclipse, 
Netbeans, and IntelliJ, from an open source library .
